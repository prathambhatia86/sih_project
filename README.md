# sih_project
A python project is added for sih_project. This project is a basic frontend framework for keeping track of students' data availing scholarship.
A unique coaching and scholarship ID is there to make the process seamless and authenticate legal coachings[note-:backend is not used in this project till now].
In this, government will put all the money in one go in the unique student account but not all the money will be accessible.
Money will be accessible to coaching on a due date so that misuse of funds does not happen.
A video is attached for your reference.
