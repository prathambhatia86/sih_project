# sih_project
A python project is added for sih_project.this project is a basic frontend framework for keeping the data of the students availing scholarship.
a unique coaching and scholarship ID is there to make the process seamless and authenticate legal coachings[note-:backend is not used in this project till now].
In this , government will put all the money in one go in the unique student account but not all the money will be accessible.
money will be accessible to coaching on a due date so that misuse of funds will not happen.
A video is attached for your reference.
